# NYCBucketList

## About
This is a redesigned of my web development project that me and my group develoed during the Spring of 2020. This website allows NYC tourist/citizens to find fun activties around NYC. A user is able to filter through a list of searches based on activity and location, create their own account, and allow them to add and remove events from their itinerary. Also, there is an admin page which allows the admin to make updates to specific events, add events, and update/delete users.
